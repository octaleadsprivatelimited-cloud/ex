# üöÄ VERCEL DEPLOYMENT - EXACT STEPS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è FOLLOW THESE EXACT STEPS TO AVOID "react-scripts" ERROR

### Step 1: Go to Vercel
1. Visit: https://vercel.com
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click **"Add New Project"**

### Step 2: Import Repository
1. Find and select: `octaleadsprivatelimited-cloud/ex`
2. Click **"Import"**

### Step 3: Configure Settings (MOST IMPORTANT!)

**Click "Edit" next to each setting:**

```
Framework Preset: Create React App
Root Directory: frontend        ‚Üê TYPE THIS EXACTLY!
```

**DO NOT override these commands - leave them as detected:**
```
Build Command: npm run build      (auto-detected)
Output Directory: build           (auto-detected)
Install Command: npm install      (auto-detected)
```

### Step 4: Environment Variables (Optional)
Skip for now - can add later if needed

### Step 5: Deploy
Click **"Deploy"** button

## ‚úÖ What This Does

When you set **Root Directory** to `frontend`:
- Vercel changes into the `frontend` folder first
- Runs `npm install` (installs react-scripts)
- Runs `npm run build` (uses react-scripts)
- Deploys the `build` folder

## üéØ The Key

**THE MOST IMPORTANT SETTING:**
```
Root Directory: frontend
```

Without this, Vercel looks in the root folder where there's no react-scripts!

---

## üì± After Deployment

Your site will be live at:
- `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

All routes will work:
- `/` - Home
- `/about` - About
- `/services` - Services
- `/contact` - Contact
- All 26+ pages!

---

## üîß If It Still Fails

1. **Check Root Directory** - Must be `frontend`
2. **Check Build Logs** - Look for where it's running commands
3. **Clear Vercel Cache** - Project Settings ‚Üí Clear Cache
4. **Redeploy** - Try again

---

**Your repository is ready:** https://github.com/octaleadsprivatelimited-cloud/ex.git

**Just set Root Directory to `frontend` and deploy!** üéâ
