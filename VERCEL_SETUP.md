## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If you get "react-scripts: command not found":

**Solution 1: Verify Root Directory**
- Make sure Root Directory is set to `frontend` (not empty!)
- This is the most common issue

**Solution 2: Clear Vercel Cache**
- In Vercel Dashboard → Project Settings
- Go to "General"
- Scroll to bottom
- Click "Clear Cache and Redeploy"

**Solution 3: Override Build Command**
In Vercel project settings, set:
```
Build Command: cd frontend && npm install && npm run build
```

### If deployment still fails:

Check the build logs in Vercel for specific errors. Common issues:
- Wrong directory setting
- Missing environment variables
- Build timeout (increase in settings)

## 📁 Current Configuration

Your repo now has:
- ✅ `frontend/vercel.json` - Vercel config in correct location
- ✅ `frontend/package.json` - Updated with CI=false
- ✅ `frontend/.vercelignore` - Files to ignore
- ✅ All dependencies properly configured

## 🌐 After Successful Deployment

Vercel will give you:
- **Production URL:** `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`
- **Preview URLs:** For every git push
- **Automatic Deployments:** On every commit to main branch

### Update API Endpoint (Important!)

After deploying, you'll need to deploy the backend separately and update API URLs in:
- `frontend/src/components/Footer.js`
- `frontend/src/pages/Contact.js`

Change from:
```javascript
'http://localhost:5000/api/...'
```

To your deployed backend URL or use environment variables.

## ✨ Features That Will Work After Deployment

- ✅ All 26+ pages
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Mobile menu with animations
- ✅ Exigo logo
- ✅ WhatsApp button
- ✅ Navigation (React Router)

Note: Contact forms won't work until you deploy the backend!

**Good luck with deployment! Your site is production-ready.** 🚀
